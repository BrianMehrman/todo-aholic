# Todo-Aholic

This is a test application that I have created from [this tutorial](http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular#frontend-application-with-angular) to learn more about mongodb.

This application uses the following tech:
* NodeJS
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* ExpressJS
* AngularJS

Please make sure you **mongodb connection is correct**. This application assumes it is through localhost on the default port.

To run this application:

```
node server.js

```
